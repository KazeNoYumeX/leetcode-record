# 1732. Find the Highest Altitude

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-highest-altitude/description/)

There is a biker going on a road trip.
The road trip consists of `n + 1` points at different altitudes.
The biker starts his trip on point `0` with altitude equal `0`.

You are given an integer array `gain` of length `n` where `gain[i]` is the **net gain in altitude** between points `i`
and `i + 1` for all `(0 <= i < n)`.
Return _the **highest altitude** of a point._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == gain.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `-100 <= gain[i] <= 100`
