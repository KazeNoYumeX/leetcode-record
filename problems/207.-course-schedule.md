# 207. Course Schedule

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/)

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`.
You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [aᵢ, bᵢ]` indicates that you **must** take course `bᵢ`
first if you want to take course `aᵢ`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]

Output: true

Explanation:
There are a total of 2 courses to take.
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0.
So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]

Output: false

Explanation:
There are a total of 2 courses to take.
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1.
So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= aᵢ, bᵢ < numCourses`
- All the pairs prerequisites\[i\] are **unique**.

            }

        $count = 0;
        while (! $queue->isEmpty()) {
            $current = $queue->dequeue();
            $count++;

            if (isset($graph[$current])) {
                foreach ($graph[$current] as $neighbor) {
                    if (--$inDegree[$neighbor] === 0) {
                        $queue->enqueue($neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }

        }

        return $count === $numCourses;
