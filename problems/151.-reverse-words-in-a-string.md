# 151. Reverse Words in a String

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/description/)

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return _a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space._

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words.
The returned string should only have a single space separating the words.
Do not include any extra spaces.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10⁴`
- `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
- There is **at least one** word in `s`.

**Follow-up**: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?
