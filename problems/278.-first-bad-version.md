# 278. First Bad Version

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/description/)

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product.
Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check.
Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one,
which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad.
Implement a function to find the first bad version.
You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4

Output: 4

Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1

Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= bad <= n <= 2³¹ - 1`

      const mid = left + Math.floor((n - left) / 2)
      if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
        n = mid - 1

            if isBadVersion(mid):
                n = mid - 1

            if ($this->isBadVersion($mid)) {
                $n = $mid - 1;
            } else {
