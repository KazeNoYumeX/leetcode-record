# 1907. Count Salary Categories

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-salary-categories/description/)

Table: `Accounts`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.
```

Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category.
The salary categories are:

- `Low Salary`: All the salaries **strictly** less than `$20000`.
- `Average Salary`: All the salaries in the **inclusive** range `[$20000, $50000]`.
- `High Salary`: All the salaries **strictly greater** than `$50000`.

The result table **must** contain all three categories.
If there are no accounts in a category, return `0`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Accounts table:
+------------+--------+
| account_id | income |
+------------+--------+
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |
+------------+--------+

Output:
+----------------+----------------+
| category       | accounts_count |
+----------------+----------------+
| Low Salary     | 1              |
| Average Salary | 0              |
| High Salary    | 3              |
+----------------+----------------+

Explanation:
Low Salary: Account 2.
Average Salary: No accounts.
High Salary: Accounts 3, 6, and 8.
```

#### SQL Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Accounts
(
    account_id int,
    income     int
);

Truncate table Accounts;

insert into Accounts (account_id, income)
values ('3', '108939');

insert into Accounts (account_id, income)
values ('2', '12747');

insert into Accounts (account_id, income)
values ('8', '87709');

insert into Accounts (account_id, income)
values ('6', '91796');
```

#### Solution

```sql
select "Low Salary" as category, sum(income < 20000) as accounts_count
from Accounts
union all
select "Average Salary" as category, sum(income between 20000 and 50000) as accounts_count
from Accounts
union all
select "High Salary" as category, sum(income > 50000) as accounts_count
from Accounts;
```
