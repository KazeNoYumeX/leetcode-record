# 2390. Removing Stars From a String

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/removing-stars-from-a-string/description/)

You are given a string `s`, which contains stars `*`.

In one operation, you can:

* Choose a star in `s`.
* Remove the closest **non-star** character to its **left**, as well as remove the star itself.

Return _the string after **all** stars have been removed_.

**Note:**

* The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
* It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
Output: "lecoe"
Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:
- The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in "leet**cod*e". s becomes "lee*cod*e".
- The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in "lee*cod*e". s becomes "lecod*e".
- The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in "lecod*e". s becomes "lecoe".
There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "erase*****"
Output: ""
Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters and stars `*`.
* The operation above can be performed on `s`.
