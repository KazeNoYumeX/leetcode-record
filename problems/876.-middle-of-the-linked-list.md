# 876. Middle of the Linked List

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return _the middle node of the linked list_.

If there are two middle nodes, return **the second middle** node.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output:
 [3,4,5]
Explanation:
 The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output:
 [4,5,6]
Explanation:
 Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
