# 392. Is Subsequence

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/)

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `s` _is a **subsequence** of_ `t`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= s.length <= 100`
* `0 <= t.length <= 10^4`
* `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Suppose there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s1, s2, ..., sk` where `k >= 10^9`, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
