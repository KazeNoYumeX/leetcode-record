# 503. Next Greater Element II

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/description/)

Given a circular integer array `nums` (i.e., the next element of `nums[nums.length - 1]` is `nums[0]`),
return _the **next greater number** for every element in_ `nums`.

The **next greater number** of a number `x` is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array,
which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number.
If it doesn't exist, return `-1` for this number.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1]

Output: [2,-1,2]

Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2;
The number 2 can't find next greater number.
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]

Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁴`
- `-10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹`

            $element = $nums[$i % $length];
            while (! empty($array) && $nums[end($array)] < $element) {
                $elements[array_pop($array)] = $element;
            }

            if ($i < $length) {
                $array[] = $i;
            }
        }

        return $elements;
    }
