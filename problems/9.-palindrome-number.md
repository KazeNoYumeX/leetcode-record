# 9. Palindrome Number

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is palindrome integer.

An integer is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward.

* For example, `121` is a palindrome while `123` is not.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Constraints:**

* `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`
