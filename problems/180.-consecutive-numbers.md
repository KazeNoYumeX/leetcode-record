# 180. Consecutive Numbers

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-numbers/description/)

Table: `Logs`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column starting from 1.
```

Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+

Output:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+

Explanation:
1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
```

#### SQL Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Logs
(
    id  int,
    num int
);

Truncate table Logs;

insert into Logs (id, num)
values ('1', '1');

insert into Logs (id, num)
values ('2', '1');

insert into Logs (id, num)
values ('3', '1');

insert into Logs (id, num)
values ('4', '2');

insert into Logs (id, num)
values ('5', '1');

insert into Logs (id, num)
values ('6', '2');

insert into Logs (id, num)
values ('7', '2');
```

#### Solution

```sql
select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums
from (select lag(num) over (order by id) as prev, num, lead(num) over (order by id) as next
      from Logs) as consecutive
where num = prev
  and num = next;
```
