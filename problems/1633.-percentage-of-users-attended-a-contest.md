# 1633. Percentage of Users Attended a Contest

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/percentage-of-users-attended-a-contest/description/)

Table: `Users`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| user_name   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a user.
```

Table: `Register`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| contest_id  | int     |
| user_id     | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(contest_id, user_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id of a user and the contest they registered into.
```

Write a solution to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to **two decimals**.

Return the result table ordered by `percentage` in **descending order**. In case of a tie, order it by `contest_id` in **ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code>Input: 
Users table:
+---------+-----------+
| user_id | user_name |
+---------+-----------+
| 6       | Alice     |
| 2       | Bob       |
| 7       | Alex      |
+---------+-----------+
Register table:
+------------+---------+
| contest_id | user_id |
+------------+---------+
| 215        | 6       |
| 209        | 2       |
| 208        | 2       |
| 210        | 6       |
| 208        | 6       |
| 209        | 7       |
| 209        | 6       |
| 215        | 7       |
| 208        | 7       |
| 210        | 2       |
| 207        | 2       |
| 210        | 7       |
+------------+---------+
<strong>Output: 
</strong>+------------+------------+
| contest_id | percentage |
+------------+------------+
| 208        | 100.0      |
| 209        | 100.0      |
| 210        | 100.0      |
| 215        | 66.67      |
| 207        | 33.33      |
+------------+------------+
<strong>Explanation: 
</strong>All the users registered in contests 208, 209, and 210. The percentage is 100% and we sort them in the answer table by contest_id in ascending order.
Alice and Alex registered in contest 215 and the percentage is ((2/3) * 100) = 66.67%
Bob registered in contest 207 and the percentage is ((1/3) * 100) = 33.33%

| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |
| activity_type  | enum    |
| timestamp      | float   |
+----------------+---------+
The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
machine_id is the ID of a machine.
process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.
```

There is a factory website that has several machines each running the **same number of processes**. Write a solution to find the **average time** each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the `'end' timestamp` minus the `'start' timestamp`. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the `machine_id` along with the **average time** as `processing_time`, which should be **rounded to 3 decimal places**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
Activity table:
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |
| 2          | 0          | start         | 4.100     |
| 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
Output: 
+------------+-----------------+
| machine_id | processing_time |
+------------+-----------------+
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |
+------------+-----------------+
Explanation: 
There are 3 machines running 2 processes each.
Machine 0's average time is ((1.520 - 0.712) + (4.120 - 3.140)) / 2 = 0.894
Machine 1's average time is ((1.550 - 0.550) + (1.420 - 0.430)) / 2 = 0.995
Machine 2's average time is ((4.512 - 4.100) + (5.000 - 2.500)) / 2 = 1.456

#### SQL Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Activity
(
    machine_id    int,
    process_id    int,
    activity_type ENUM ('start', 'end'),
    timestamp     float
);

Truncate table Activity;

insert into Activity (machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp)
values ('0', '0', 'start', '0.712');

insert into Activity (machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp)
values ('0', '0', 'end', '1.52');

insert into Activity (machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp)
values ('0', '1', 'start', '3.14');

insert into Activity (machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp)
values ('0', '1', 'end', '4.12');

insert into Activity (machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp)
values ('1', '0', 'start', '0.55');

insert into Activity (machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp)
values ('1', '0', 'end', '1.55');

insert into Activity (machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp)
values ('1', '1', 'start', '0.43');

insert into Activity (machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp)
values ('1', '1', 'end', '1.42');

insert into Activity (machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp)
values ('2', '0', 'start', '4.1');

insert into Activity (machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp)
values ('2', '0', 'end', '4.512');

insert into Activity (machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp)
values ('2', '1', 'start', '2.5');

insert into Activity (machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp)
values ('2', '1', 'end', '5');
```

#### Solution

```sql
select a1.machine_id, round(avg(a1.timestamp - a2.timestamp), 3) as processing_time
from Activity as a1
         join Activity as a2
              on a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id and a1.process_id = a2.process_id and a1.activity_type = 'end' and
                 a2.activity_type = 'start'
group by a1.machine_id;
```
