# 1710. Maximum Units on a Truck

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-units-on-a-truck/description/)

You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto **one truck**.
You are given a 2D array `boxTypes`, where `boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesᵢ, numberOfUnitsPerBoxᵢ]`:

- `numberOfBoxesᵢ` is the number of boxes of type `i`.
- `numberOfUnitsPerBoxᵢ` is the number of units in each box of the type `i`.

You are also given an integer `truckSize`, which is the **maximum** number of **boxes** that can be put on the truck.
You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed `truckSize`.

Return _the **maximum** total number of **units** that can be put on the truck._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], truckSize = 4

Output: 8

Explanation:
There are:
  - 1 box of the first type that contains 3 units.
  - 2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each.
  - 3 boxes of the third type that contain 1 unit each.
You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the third type.
The total number of units will be = (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 8.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: boxTypes = [[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]], truckSize = 10

Output: 91
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= boxTypes.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= numberOfBoxesᵢ, numberOfUnitsPerBoxᵢ <= 1000`
- `1 <= truckSize <= 10⁶`
