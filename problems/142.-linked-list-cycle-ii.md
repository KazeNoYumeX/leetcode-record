# 142. Linked List Cycle II

Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return_ `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following
the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected
to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

**Do not modify** the linked list.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output:
 tail connects to node index 1
Explanation:
 There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist\_test2.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output:
 tail connects to node index 0
Explanation:
 There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist\_test3.png)

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output:
 no cycle
Explanation:
 There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
* `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
* `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?
