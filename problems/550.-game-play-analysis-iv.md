# 550. Game Play Analysis IV

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-iv/description/)

Table: `Activity`

```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
```

Write a solution to report the **fraction** of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, **rounded to 2 decimal places**

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
Output: 
+-----------+
| fraction  |
+-----------+
| 0.33      |
+-----------+
Explanation: 
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33
```

#### SQL Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Activity
(
    player_id    int,
    device_id    int,
    event_date   date,
    games_played int
);

Truncate table Activity;

insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played)
values ('1', '2', '2016-03-01', '5');

insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played)
values ('1', '2', '2016-03-02', '6');

insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played)
values ('2', '3', '2017-06-25', '1');

insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played)
values ('3', '1', '2016-03-02', '0');

insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played)
values ('3', '4', '2018-07-03', '5');
```

#### Solution

```sql
select round(count(player_id) / (select count(distinct player_id) from Activity), 2) as fraction
from Activity
where (player_id, event_date) in (select player_id, date_add(min(event_date), interval 1 day) as first_logged_players
                                  from Activity
                                  group by player_id);
```
