# 176. Second Highest Salary

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/description/)

Table: `Employee`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
```

Write a solution to find the second-highest **distinct** salary from the `Employee` table.
If there is no second-highest salary, return `null` (return `None` in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+

Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+

Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
```

#### SQL Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Employee
(
    id     int,
    salary int
);

Truncate table Employee;

insert into Employee (id, salary)
values ('1', '100');

insert into Employee (id, salary)
values ('2', '200');

insert into Employee (id, salary)
values ('3', '300');
```

#### Solution

```sql
select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
from Employee
where salary < (select max(salary) from Employee);
```
