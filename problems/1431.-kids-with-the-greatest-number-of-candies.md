# 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies/description/)

There are `n` kids with candies. You are given an integer array `candies`, where each `candies[i]` represents the number
of candies the `iᵗʰ` kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return _a boolean array_ `result` _of length_ `n`_, where_ `result[i]` _is_ `true` _if, after giving the_ `iᵗʰ` _kid all
the_ `extraCandies`_, they will have the **greatest** number of candies among all the kids, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

Note that **multiple** kids can have the **greatest** number of candies.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true]
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false]
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy.
Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == candies.length`
- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= candies[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= extraCandies <= 50`
