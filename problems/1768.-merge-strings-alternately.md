# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/description/)

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting
with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return _the merged string._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q
merged: a p b q c   d
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.
