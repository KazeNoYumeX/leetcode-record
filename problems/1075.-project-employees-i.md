Write an SQL query that reports the **products** that were **only** sold in the first quarter of `2019`. That is, between `2019-01-01` and `2019-03-31` inclusive.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
Product table:
+------------+--------------+------------+
| product_id | product_name | unit_price |
+------------+--------------+------------+
| 1          | S8           | 1000       |
| 2          | G4           | 800        |
| 3          | iPhone       | 1400       |
+------------+--------------+------------+
Sales table:
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| seller_id | product_id | buyer_id | sale_date  | quantity | price |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| 1         | 1          | 1        | 2019-01-21 | 2        | 2000  |
| 1         | 2          | 2        | 2019-02-17 | 1        | 800   |
| 2         | 2          | 3        | 2019-06-02 | 1        | 800   |
| 3         | 3          | 4        | 2019-05-13 | 2        | 2800  |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
Output:
+-------------+--------------+
| product_id  | product_name |
+-------------+--------------+
| 1           | S8           |
+-------------+--------------+
Explanation:
The product with id 1 was only sold in the spring of 2019.
The product with id 2 was sold in the spring of 2019 but was also sold after the spring of 2019.
The product with id 3 was sold after spring 2019.
We return only product 1 as it is the product that was only sold in the spring of 2019.

#### SQL Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Product
(
    product_id   int,
    product_name varchar(10),
    unit_price   int
);

Create table If Not Exists Sales
(
    seller_id  int,
    product_id int,
    buyer_id   int,
    sale_date  date,
    quantity   int,
    price      int
);

Truncate table Product;

insert into Product (product_id, product_name, unit_price)
values ('1', 'S8', '1000');

insert into Product (product_id, product_name, unit_price)
values ('2', 'G4', '800');

insert into Product (product_id, product_name, unit_price)
values ('3', 'iPhone', '1400');

Truncate table Sales;

insert into Sales (seller_id, product_id, buyer_id, sale_date, quantity, price)
values ('1', '1', '1', '2019-01-21', '2', '2000');

insert into Sales (seller_id, product_id, buyer_id, sale_date, quantity, price)
values ('1', '2', '2', '2019-02-17', '1', '800');

insert into Sales (seller_id, product_id, buyer_id, sale_date, quantity, price)
values ('2', '2', '3', '2019-06-02', '1', '800');

insert into Sales (seller_id, product_id, buyer_id, sale_date, quantity, price)
values ('3', '3', '4', '2019-05-13', '2', '2800');
```

#### Solution

```sql
select product_id, product_name
from Sales
         join Product using (product_id)
group by product_id
having min(sale_date) >= '2019-01-01'
   and max(sale_date) <= '2019-03-31'
```
